explanation: 
I will establish and maintain continuity in my work by using temporal continuity as all the events in my video happens in the order of my own daily routine, starting with me getting out of bed in the morning ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/gettingoutofbed.png), and going to sleep at night ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/goingtosleep.png), and putting all my daily activities in order during my edit. I will also establish temporal discontinuity by using jump cuts.

The main theme of my work is to tell my viewers about my interests and personality in the form of my daily routine. I will achieve this with my approach to editing by showing a clip of me waking up in the intro and add a fade in transition to it ![see screennshot in](/w01s1/fadein.png), and a clip of me going to sleep with a fade out transition to it ![see screenshot in](/01s1/fadeout.png). The emotion I hope to offer my viewers is a relaxed feeling, and I will achieve this with my approach to editing by adding a peaceful background music and make long cuts with long cross dissolve out fade in and fade out transitions between them.
