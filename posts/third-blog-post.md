explanation: I will establish and maintain continuity in my work by using temporal continuity as all the events in my video happens in the order of my own daily routine, starting with me getting out of bed in the morning ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/gettingoutofbed.png), and going to sleep at night ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/goingtosleep.png), and putting all my daily activities in order during my edit.
