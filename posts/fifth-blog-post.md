process of producing this draft:
During the process, I picked a relaxing piano song from the youtube audio library as my background music in order to create a relaxed mood for my audience. I made the duration of most of my clips very long and added long fade or cross dissolve transitions between each them to tell my audience that I'm a slow paced person. I chose to keep the audio of most of my footages, such as the sound of the crowd talking in public, sound of me playing on my table soccer machine and the sound of my cats meowing, and made the their volumes louder than the volume of my background music to create a sense of natural feeling and further enhances the relaxed mood of my work. I also used a jump cut from the scene when I was doing workouts in my home gym to show me working hard ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/gymwork1.png) and ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/gymwork2.png). When I fade in to the scene of me playing piano, I made the sound of my original background music slowly fade out and made the audio of myself playing piano slowly fade in to create a smooth audio transition between the 2 piano audios.
