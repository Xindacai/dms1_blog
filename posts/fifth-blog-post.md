process of producing this draft:
During the process, I picked a relaxing piano song from the youtube audio library as my background music in order to create a relaxed mood for my audience. I made the duration of most of my clips very long and added long fade or cross dissolve transitions between each them to tell my audience that I'm a slow paced person. I also used a jump cut from the scene when I was doing workouts in my home gym to show me workin hard ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/gymwork1.png) and ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/gymwork2.png).
