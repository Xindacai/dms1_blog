reflection for the edit:
During the process of this edit, I wished to tell the story of the importance of exercise. I'm aiming to express that the person sitting in his room is spending too much time looking at his phone and watching tv at the very start, which I made the starting clip quite long in duration to emphasize that ![see](/w01s1/screenshot1.png) ![and](/w01s1/screenshot2.png). I want to say that the person in the first clip should start doing some exercise and have a phone break, so in the next scene I added some flashing (1-2 frames) images of some gym equipments on top of the clip of the person looking at his phone from the video I shot in my home gym ![see evidence in](/w01s1/screenshot3.png), on the screen is a screenshot of my home gym, and those pink squares I circled in the bottom are small bits of this screenshot I added to make the flash effect. In the next scene of the edit, I added the full footage of me touring around to show the equipments of my home gym, which is the longest clip I added in my entire edit, and this is a further message to the audience about the importance of exercise ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/screenshot4.png) ![and](/w01s1/screenshot5.png). Then towards the end of the clip of me touring around my home gym, I added more flashbacks of the living room the person was in to give a comparisom ![see](/w01s1/screenshot6.png) to show that it's better to be in the gym than to stay in the living room. In the end, I switched back to the scene of the person still looking at his phone, so it seems like I'm reminding the person to get off his phone and start exercising to my audience ![see](/w01s1/screenshot7.png). I feel like my edit is mostly successful as I think my story is quite easy to understand, and I even added some creative elements in this experiments. However, I think I can make the story more attractive by making the edit longer and add more content.
