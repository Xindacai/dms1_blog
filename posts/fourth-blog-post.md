snippet: This is an excerpt of my fourth blog post.

The key moment I planned for my 2 minutes edit will be the moment where I show myself playing piano ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/piano.png) then cutting to the scene where I teach my cat how to play piano ![see screenshots in](/w01s1/catplayspiano.png)and ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/catplayspianonext.png) and my cat playing in the metronome ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/piano.png).

I plan to use L cut in this scene to keep the audio of my piano music playing all the way as the scene switches to the clip of my cat trying press on the piano keyboard, and in the next clip of my cat playing my metronome, I will have its audio slowly fading in while the piano music still keeps playing and both audios fade out as this scene ends ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/Lcut.png).

The emotional tone of my broader portrait is relaxing and my editing choice will generally support that choice as I applied a long audio and video fade in effect at the start of the scene of me playing piano ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/audiofadeinlong.png), and then an extremely long audio fade out for my piano audio which happens before switching to the next 2 scenes ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/audiofadeout.png), and then another long video and audio fade out for that last scene of my cat playing on my metronome ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/catmetronome.png). In doing so, I intend to make the audio of this part sounds very slow paced which adds to the context of the peaceful and relaxing mood I'm trying to creat for my work.
