snippet: This is an excerpt of my fourth blog post.

The key moment I planned for my 2 minutes edit will be the moment where I show myself playing piano then citting to the scene where I teach my cat how to play piano and my cat playing in the metronome ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/piano.png).

I plan to use L cut in this scene to keep the audio of my piano music playing all the way as the scene switches to the clip of my cat trying press on the piano keyboard, and in the next clip of my cat playing my metronome, I will have its audio slowly fading in while the piano music still keeps playing and both audios fade out as this scene ends ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/Lcut.png).
