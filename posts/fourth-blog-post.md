The key moment I planned for my 2 minutes edit will be the moment where I show myself playing piano (see screenshot)![see screenshot in](/w01s1/piano.png) then cutting to the scene where I teach my cat how to play piano (see screenshot) ![see screenshots in](/w01s1/catplayspiano.png)and (see screenshot) ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/catplayspianonext.png) and my cat playing in the metronome (see screenshot) ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/catmetronome.png).

I plan to use L cut in this scene to keep the audio of my piano music playing all the way as the scene switches to the clip of my cat trying press on the piano keyboard, and in the next clip of my cat playing with my metronome, I will have its audio slowly fading in while the piano music still keeps playing and both audios fade out as this scene ends ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/Lcut.png).

The emotional tone of my broader portrait is relaxing and my editing choice will generally support that choice as I applied a long audio and video fade in effect at the start of the scene of me playing piano (see screenshot) ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/audiofadeinlong.png), and then an extremely long audio fade out for my piano audio which happens before switching to the next 2 scenes (see screenshot) ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/audiofadeout.png), and then another long video and audio fade out for that last scene of my cat playing on my metronome (see screenshot) ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/catmetronome.png). In doing so, I intend to make the audio and video of this part sound very slow paced which adds to the context of the peaceful and relaxing mood I'm trying to creat for my work.

The audience needs to understand that all the shots in this moment are mainly related to the moment of me practicing piano and producing music, and letting my pets play on my piano when they are around. I'm trying to forge the connection between my passion towards music making and playing with my cats.

I'm attempting to establish a relatively slow pace during this moment. My editing will produce this as I will make the duration of this moment much longer than all the other moments throughout my work (see screenshot) ![see screenshot in](/w01s1/long.png). I will also produce this by adding long audio fade in and fade outs during this section.
