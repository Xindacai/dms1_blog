we found this amongst many which we found in the library in building 12 of the campus, this was a pretty easy find as we managed to discover this book in the first level of the library

we discovered this while looking down through the glass door on the second floor of the library, and this was relatively difficult to find since it's hung on the ceiling of building 12 near the third level of the library

we discovered this in the second floor of the library, and we had to walk towards the very end of the library area on the second floor to from this hidden space

we found this near the front entrance of building 8 and this discovery took us some times as we walked in the wrong direction to look for this structure at first

we found this outside the entrance of building 6, and this was one of our quickest finds as it's very close to our classroom

we discovered this on the street outside the campus and this was one of our most difficult finds as we have mistaken it as a different structure within our campus at first

we found this near the RUSU computer club located in the basement of building 8, this was a very easy find since all of us expected this place to be located underground

we discovered this in the cafeteria next to the entrance of building 8 and this was definitely our hardest find throughout the scavenger hunt as none of us knew what explosive coffees are so we looked over every single cafeteria in our campus before finding it

we discovered this in a park outside of our campus and we happened to find this on the way of looking for other structures during the scavenger hunt which was lucky

we found this outside the back entrance to building 12 and the process of searching for this structure was very confusing since we have never heard of this term before
